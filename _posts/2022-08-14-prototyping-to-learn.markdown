Within the design and development process; from discovery, definition, development and delivery. Very often, prototyping typically gets utilised towards the latter half of the process only. We tend to all feel positive about prototypes but don't tend to take action on it.

So not only prototyping to validate a design, how about thinking of prototyping as a way of learning. Regardless of project complexity, prototyping has a lot of value. When it comes to user facing products and services, nobody knows what will work or what will not work without actual people using it. Too much discussion results in long meetings stuck in conjecture.

We could say that that there are at least three types of prototyping:
1. Interactive (e.g. digital)
2. Physical (e.g. moving through a physical space)
3. Conversational (e.g. written communication, real life)
