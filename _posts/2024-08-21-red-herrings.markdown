Product development - distinguishing between distractions (red herrings) and real problems:
1. The shiny new thing... -> do we really understand the problem?
2. Problems we created ourselves -> need to solve the root problem
3. Sudden problems -> is it persistant or something just passing?
4. Real customer problem but doesn't hurt the business -> what will happen if we do nothing?
