      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The goal of this project was to redesign the app by first defining the information architecture. This was a key step to ensure we had a strong foundation before we could move forward.</p>
      <p>The redesign was driven by sunsetting legacy technology; by changing the underlying framework, new possibilities opened up.</p>
      <p>Vyond's service consists of 2 apps: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>the studio</b> - for creating animated videos</li>
        <li><b>the character creator</b> - for creating customizable characters</li>
      </ol>

### Background

I joined Vyond in the Hong Kong office in the early days, 20-30 members, largely developers, 3 designers, minimal process, at the precipice of product-market fit, rolling up the sleeves type work, to say the least. I regularly engaged with different departments and colleagues in Taiwan and San Francisco.

I learnt a lot — product development, collaboration and agile processes, as well as process itself as the company doubled in size each year, outgrowing 2 offices in the span of the 4 years that I worked there.  Below are a some of the key achievements:

- **Design process.** The design team doubled yet we lacked design process, causing inefficiencies and hurting transparency. Adding some structured design process streamlined workflows and improved collaboration with other teams.
- **Improving usability.** As the app is quite complex, usability issues could easily impact user satisfaction. Running usability tests on a regular cadence helped us improve the usability continuously. I would also share concise summary of findings with other departments, this helped build the user empathy and lead to more user-centric decisions.
- **User onboarding.** Recognizing the crucial steps for new users to succeed from their first login helped overcome the app's steep learning curve and decreased subscription churn.
- **Ensure design consistency and cohesion.** By ensuring designers adhered to reusable interaction patterns, we were able to maintain a consistent user experience across both apps as well as allowing the design and development teams to work more efficiently and focus on higher-level design challenges.

### Process

For this project, we went through the stages of the double diamond — from research, content auditing, modelling and developing the pattern.

### Research & Discovery

As we were conducting regular user interviews and user tests, it became clear that there was a problem brewing and it meant significant rework. 

During these sessions, I identified several pain points and areas where users struggled with the app's navigation. The magnitude of the issues meant that minor tweaks wouldn't be enough.

### Defining the Problem

So, it was quite late into the redesign of the platform, we ran into some problems:

1. Growing design team — each member was adding features without considering the whole experience. This was detrimental to scaling the app and delivering a good user experience.
2. Inconsistent navigation for accessing content and various options
3. Low cohesion - the content provided in the app had little consistency amongst the various panels making it difficult to find anything

<mark>Vyond has a huge library of assets and each asset contains many properties. The number of assets and options is overwhelming and adds a lot of mental load and friction for users.</mark>

<mark>On top of the app's library of content, users create their own characters, import content and ask us to customize assets too.</mark>

### Content Audit

I audited the content for our entire ecosystem and mapped out the relationships, allowing us to visualise the connections and the gaps.

### Develop

Taking the content mapping and translating it into a repeatable design pattern. 

With this, I could share with designers to apply the pattern to existing and new designs. I also worked closely with developers and explained how to use the pattern and to ensure transparency amongst the teams.

The pattern took into account our full spectrum of users:
- **primary** - video creators
- **secondary** - managers (gatekeepers)
- **lifecycle stages** - beginners, intermediate and advanced users.

### Validating Design

With the updated designers, I once again ran user tests and this time, they were able to successfully complete most of the tasks. The pattern created was not meant to be perfect and what followed was a lot of trial and error as each team member used the pattern. Overall it worked well.

Here is the end result that I screen grabbed from the production site; the design pattern is shown in the short (26 secs) video clip below. It shows the pattern applied to how users browse, apply, save and reuse colors.

### Reflections

The most challenging part was persuading stakeholders that it was necessary to go back and work on something foundational so late in the game. 

Designers and developers were also needing some convincing, as it meant giving up a bit of creative freedom, and having to adopt something quite rigid and sometimes didn't necessarily make sense.

The constraints made by the pattern resulted in tough conversations within the design team but ultimately made the work stronger.
