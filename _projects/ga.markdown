### Background

I joined Vyond in the Hong Kong office in the early days, 20-30 members, largely developers, 3 designers (expanded to 6), minimal process, at the precipice of product-market fit, rolling up the sleeves type work, to say the least ‚Äî I learnt a lot about growth, teamwork and agile processes, and well, process itself as the company doubled in size each year, outgrowing 2 offices in the span of 4 short years that I worked there. 

Vyond's service consists of a couple of apps ‚Äî the studio for making videos and the character creator. We were tasked with completely redesigning as we shifted away from legacy technology. A move that was highly risky but essential to thrive.

**Key Achievements**
- **Implement design process.** This established structure to how we work, giving other teams greater visibility to the design team's work.
- **Align designers with reusable patterns.** This helped to maintain a consistent user experience across the two apps as we were building them in parallel.
- **Improving usability.** Running usability tests on a regular cadence helped us improve the usability continuously but also sharing short summary of findings with other departments helped build the user empathy.
- **Creating a consistent browsing experience** (detailed below)
- **Onboarding** new and existing users
- **User test.** Plan, script and run countless user tests
- **Established design processes.** When I joined, there was very little process in place, which was manageable initially, but as we grew, it had become increasingly necessary to ensure

### Process

We went through the stages of the double diamond, from research, content auditing, modelling and developing the idea.

### Research & Diccovery

We were running regular user testing sessions as we built up the beta. It really helped us to take some steps back when things didn't work out as expected. 

Eventually, the user tests and the user interviews made it clear that there was a problem brewing.

---

### Defining the Problem

Quite late into the redesign of the platform, we ran into some problems:

1. growing design team ‚Äî each member was adding features without considering the whole experience was detrimental to scaling the app and delivering a good user experience
2. inconsistent navigation for content and options
3. the content provided in the app had little consistency amongst the various panels making it difficult to find anything

<mark>Vyond has a huge library of assets and each asset contains many properties. The number of assets and options is overwhelming and adds a lot of mental load and friction for users.</mark>

<mark>On top of the app's library of content, users create their own characters, import content and ask us to customize assets too.</mark>

### Content Audit

I audited the content for our entire ecosystem and mapped out the relationships. By mapping the app content out ‚Äî it helped us to visualize how everything connected and areas that had gaps.

### Develop

Taking the mapping and translating it into a repeatable design pattern. With this, I could share it with designers where we worked together to turn it into a tangible prototype.

The pattern took into account our **primary** (video creators) and **secondary** (managers and gatekeepers) **personas** as well as different **lifecycle stages** (beginners, intermediate and advanced).

### Validating Designs & Results !

With the updated designers, I once again ran user tests and this time, they were to able to successfully complete the tasks.

An example of the design pattern is shown in the short (26 secs) video clip below. It shows the pattern applied to how users browse, apply, save and re-use colors.

### Reflections üç™

We can be defiant to this approach of applying cookie cutter approach to design but it frees up design and development time to look at more challenging problems.
