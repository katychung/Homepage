### Background
Goodpatch is a leading design agency in Japan. I was lucky enough to have gotten a chance to join them for this short contract project that they had with a Japanese entertainment („Ç®„É≥„Çø„É°) company who had some stringest requirements for a mobile app but needed some help with the design. The company has a strong interanational presence and a recognizeable brand and lots of intellectual property.

The development was outsourced to a seperate development company. Communications were daily, meetings were long.

It was my first time to work entirely with Japanese members and so it was a great challenge in terms of culture and language difference üôåüèº

### Process
As the client had a defined scope, timeline and expected specific deliverables, we had to first take their requirements and to turn them into something tangible for initial conversations. Within a short time frame, we:

- **brainstorm assumptions and questions.** This helped to clarify expectations and to get on the same page.
- **personas creation.** This helped to guide design decisions around the end user
- **formulate a strategy.** This helped everyone see the bigger picture and to visualize the outcome.
- **created high level wireframes in Figma.** This helped us get quick feedback from the client.

### Planning

Alongside the other Goodpatch team members, we interpreted the requirements, defined the user, store and business needs. 

We started with wireframing at a very high level the key flows of the app. Having a tangible wireframe for those early conversations was really helpful in getting the client's to feel more comfortable in sharing their thoughts and getting the project moving forward.

### Collaboration

We held daily meetings with the stakeholders to understand their primary and secondary target users, defined the underlying concept, worked within their brand guidelines and presented various directions and handed off the specifications to the external dev teams to deliver the final product.

### Development & Design

Wireframes, prototyping, client review. Complete design system for handoff.
The final designs and specifiations were handed over to the external development team to complete the iOS and Android app.

### Reflection
Most of my experience in startups and designing for B2B, working with a design agency on a B2C project was a refreshing change of pace and the challenges that I had to adapt to have helped me grow. 

Agencies value the client relationship, speed, polish and presentation, while startsup are user-obsessed, hypothesis driven and iterative by nature.
