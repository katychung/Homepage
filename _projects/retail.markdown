### Background
Flow is a data analytics platform for Japan's retail industry.

I am the sole designer at the company working with the founder, lead engineer, sales, marketing and operations as well as offshore development members. I support design across every aspect of our business and am responsible for leading UX and UI across their web and mobile app.

**Key achievements**:
- **Establish design process.** Adding structure helped the team focus better and gave greater visibility to other departments
- **Create design system.** This helped bring consistency to design and development as well as providing a more consistent experience for end users.
- **Improve usability.** Actively improve usability through the use of heuristics and best practices.
- **Creating prototypes.** Previously, prototypes were not used, instead the designer created static mockups which were handed-off to developers. With a prototype, we could first validate the designs as well as increase communication early on in the development process.

### Process
It typically varies by project depending on complexity and timeline. For this particular project, I followed the double diamond process from research (generative), problem definition, ideation to delivery.

### Understanding the Problem
Before I joined Flow, the platform was designed to deliver the store analytics without much thought about the user experience. Much of the service was driven by tech. 

Moving forward with the platform, there was a need to take a few steps back, conduct some generative research by talking to the stores and to uncover insights to help us move forward in development with a user centred approach.

---

### Research
Doing generative research was a necessary first step, talking to the retail store managers (the primary users), asking questions, validating assumptions.

- Identifying the participants, recruiting, formuling the test plan
- Understanding the store manager's needs, daily tasks and challenges - asking a simple <mark>"walk me through your day yesterday"</mark>
- Creating a centralised repository of all the interview recordings and transcriptions
- Analysed, tagged, affinity diagrammed and summarised insights
- Created a two-page report to shared key findings with stakeholders

---

### Gathering Insights
We interviewed over 20 experienced store managers from 6 different companies with store managers who use our platform. Over those interviews, we got to understand their job role, their daily tasks, challenges and how they use data.

With all the user interviews gathered in one place, we grouped the problems under common themes. 

---

### Creating a Strategy
There was a necessary step to create a strategy that could direct us in the longer term as we move from corporate to store users. Reprioritizing many features to be around the store meant:
- Prioritising store information and data that they can use throughout the work day
- Reduce need to "analyze" data through easy to understand visualizations
- UI improvements - reduce cognitive effort through visually grouping content

---

### Validating Designs
We conducted user testing to check whether the new design solved their problems. As the design doesn't lend itself to task-based user testing, I opted for a more exploratory style of user test. I created a user test script with a scenario split into 3 sections, each section preceded with questions about the scenario and how they approach the matter.

During the sessions, we observed which parts of the new design resonated and which parts they seemed to not quite understand. We learnt that the initial setup process for the store dashboard was a little too time consuming and that it was easier to have some predefined starter templates. This would let them use the service right away while allowing them customize at their own pace.

---

### Developing the Designs
The designs were created in Figma, with the main user flows prototyped to facilitate discussions. I would then write up the product documentation so that any member can refer back to in the case of needing to understand how something works.

### Results
Project is ongoing but initial iteration is complete and feedback gathering is in progress.
