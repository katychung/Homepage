      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Flow is a B2B SaaS data analytics platform aimed at retailer in Japan. The platform connects to store data sources — the POS, cameras, traffic sensors, collecting and displaying data on a dashboard and via various reports.</p>
      <p>I am the sole designer at the company working directly with the founder, lead engineer, customer success as well as offshore development members. It is a small team and I support design across the web and mobile app.</p>

### Challenge
The combination of Japan's declining population, an aging society, and the rise of e-commerce is forcing brick-and-mortar retail stores to continuously evolve their customer experience in order to attract and retain customers. 

Moreover, the company's growth has stagnated, which is further compounded by the lack of a clear value proposition. Key design issues, such as confusing data visualizations, poor information architecture, and the absence of a user onboarding flow, also hinder the service's potential.

### Goals
- Define a strategy based on the company vision, business goals and user needs.
- Shift focus to empowering frontline store staff with data-informed insights
- Increase transparency and knowledge sharing among stores
- Improve design language, information architecture, the data visualisations for easy comprehension and overall usability 

### Purpose
Empowering frontline store staff with data-informed insights so that they can improve store performance.

### Research, Synthesis and Findings

<img src="/assets/img/interviews.png" class="rounded" alt="Repository of User Interviews">

Interviews with 25+ store managers from 6 different companies. Over those interviews, we got to understand their job role, their daily tasks, challenges and how they use data.

Findings in a nutshell: low data literacy, high staff turnover, low customer service skills impacting sales, no knowledge transfer and a lack of communication and information sharing among stores.

### Solution

The solution combines data-informed insights with users' qualitative feedback to create a rich repository of all stores, enabling tailored insights and suggestions that enhance performance and increase transparency among stores.


### Layout & Hierarchy

- Added visual hierachy to communicate the priority of the information shown.
- Layouts and section headings to facilitate natural scanning and information finding. 
- Introduce more types of data visualzations appropriate to the task.
