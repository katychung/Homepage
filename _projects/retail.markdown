        <h2>Backgound</h2>
        <p>Flow is a B2B SaaS data analytics platform aimed at retailers in Japan. The platform connects to store data sources â€” the POS, cameras, traffic sensors, collecting and displaying data on a dashboard and via various reports.</p>
        <p>I am the sole designer at the company working directly with the founder, lead engineer, customer success as well as offshore development members. It is a small team and I support design across the web and mobile app.</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The combination of Japan's declining population, an aging society, and the rise of e-commerce is forcing brick-and-mortar retail stores to continuously evolve their customer experience in order to attract and retain customers.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the company's growth has stagnated, which is further compounded by the lack of a clear value proposition. Key design issues, such as confusing data visualizations, poor information architecture, and the absence of a user onboarding flow, also hinder the service's potential.</p>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Define a strategy based on the company vision, business goals, and user needs.</li>
      <li>Shift focus to empowering frontline store staff with data-informed insights.</li>
      <li>Increase transparency and knowledge sharing among stores.</li>
      <li>Improve design language, information architecture, the data visualizations for easy comprehension, and overall usability.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Empowering frontline store staff with data-informed insights so that they can improve store performance.</p>

    <h2>Research, Synthesis, and Findings</h2>
    <img src="/assets/img/interviews.png" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="Repository of User Interviews">
    <p>Interviews with 25+ store managers from 6 different companies. Over those interviews, we got to understand their job role, their daily tasks, challenges, and how they use data.</p>
    <p><b>Findings in a nutshell</b>: low data literacy, high staff turnover, low customer service skills impacting sales, no knowledge transfer, and a lack of communication and information sharing among stores.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>The solution combines data-informed insights with user's qualitative feedback to create a rich repository of the retailer. This enables tailored insights and suggestions that enhance performance and increase transparency among stores.</p>
