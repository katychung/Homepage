        <h2>üéØ Overview</h2>
        <p>Flow is a B2B SaaS data platform for retailers in Japan. It aggregates in-store data ‚Äî from POS systems, cameras, and foot traffic sensors ‚Äî and delivers it through dashboards and reports.</p>
        <p>The goal: empower frontline staff with data-informed insights to improve store performance and knowledge sharing.</p>
        <p>I work across web and mobile, collaborating with the founder, lead engineer, customer success, and offshore dev teams to improve usability, clarity, and product value.</p>

    <h3>üîç Background & Challenge</h3>
    <p>Japan‚Äôs retail landscape faces complex pressures: an aging population, rising e-commerce competition, and labor shortages. Physical stores need to adapt their customer experience ‚Äî but many struggle due to low data literacy and high staff turnover.</p>
    <p>Flow‚Äôs own growth had stalled, hindered by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A vague value proposition</li>
      <li>Poor onboarding</li>
      <li>Confusing dashboards and visualizations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In-store staff often had low data literacy and lacked tools for cross-location knowledge sharing.</p>

    <h3>üéØ Project Goals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Define a strategy based on the company vision, business goals, and user needs</li>
      <li>Empower frontline staff with clear, contextual insights</li>
      <li>Enable internal knowledge sharing between store locations</li>
      <li>Improve usability, clarity, and trust through better design language and IA</li>

   <h3>üß≠ Process & Approach</h3>
   <p>We followed a Double Diamond approach, adapted to a fast-moving startup context:</p>
   <h4>1. Discover: UX Audit & Research</h4>
       <img src="/assets/img/interviews.png" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="Repository of User Interviews">
       <img src="/assets/img/retail-existing.png" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="Existing UI">
   <ul>
    <li>Audited the current product‚Äôs structure, visualizations, and usability.</li>
    <li>Conducted <strong>25+ interviews</strong> with store managers across 6 retail brands to understand tasks, pain points, and context</li>
    <li>Synthesized findings into themes: low data literacy, high turnover, poor knowledge sharing, and siloed communication</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>2. Define: Framing the Problem</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Mapped key flows (e.g., report review, store comparison)</li>
    <li>Identified friction points and areas for design leverage</li>
    <li>Aligned with leadership on UX priorities and success criteria</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>3. Develop: Design Exploration & Prototyping</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Reorganized dashboard structure around user goals</li>
    <li>Introduced modular layouts with clear visual hierarchy</li>
    <li>Designed new visualizations tailored to the audience‚Äôs data fluency</li>
    <li>Prototyped and tested new flows for onboarding and navigation</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>4. Deliver: Ongoing Implementation & Feedback Loops</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Worked with engineers to iterate weekly on implementation</li>
    <li>Built feedback loops with internal stakeholders</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="container content-wrapper">
    <h2>‚ú® Key Design Improvement</h2>
    <p>We redesigned key parts of the experience to make insights more accessible and actionable for retail staff.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Re-prioritized content based on user behavior and feedback</li>
      <li>Added clear hierarchy and scannable layouts to reduce cognitive load</li>
      <li>Introduced new types of visualizations tailored to user tasks</li>
      <li>Structured headings and layout patterns to support findability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üí¨ Reflection</h2>
    <p>This has been a challenging but rewarding experience ‚Äî driving product clarity from within a small team, in a market with low digital maturity. It‚Äôs sharpened my ability to design for low-literacy, high-turnover environments, and to advocate for user-centered design in ambiguous, high-stakes situations.</p>
