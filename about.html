<h2>Hello — I'm Katy.</h2>
<p>Born and raised in the UK, I'm a UX Designer with a BSc in Interactive Media Design and over a decade of cross-cultural design experience.</p>

<p>I’ve worked in London, Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Tokyo — leading UX initiatives across startups, design studios, and a global IT corporation. Along the way, I’ve partnered with multidisciplinary teams to research, plan, design, test, and launch products that deliver real value for both users and businesses.</p>

<p>I speak native English, fluent Cantonese and conversational Japanese (JLPT N2).</p>
