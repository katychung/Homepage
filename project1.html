      <p>Date - May 2022 - August 2022</p>
      <p>Team - Goodpatch designers and two product managers. Daily meetings with the client and other external development teams.</p>
      <p>Deliverables - personas, wireframes, low and high fidelity prototypes. Predominantly working with Figma, Figjam, Miro. MS Teams, Slack and Discord.</p>

      <p class="font-monospace">Context</p>
      <p>Contractual project for a large Japanese entertainment (エンタメ) company in need of a mobile app to accompany their expanding number of stores throughout the country. </p></div>
      
      <p class="font-monospace">Research and Understand</p>
        <p>This was a very fast paced project with strict requirements from the outset. Alongside the designers, we translated the written requirements into a tangible solution for the client. Along this path, we sought to understand their user needs, store needs and to satisfy their business requirements. </p>

        <p>We held daily meetings with the stakeholders to understand their primary and secondary target users, defined the underlying concept, worked within their brand guidelines and presented various directions and handed off the specifications to the external dev teams to deliver the final product.</p>
    
    <div class="row py-5">
      <p class="font-monospace">Solution</p>
      <p>The final designs and specifiations were handed over to the external development team to complete the iOS and Android app. </p>
    
    <div class="row py-5">
      <p class="font-monospace">Reflection</p>
      <p>Most of my experience in startups and B2B apps, working with a design agency was a refreshing change of pace and definetely had some challenges that I had to adapt to. Agencies value the client relationship, speed, polish and presentation, while startsup are user-obsessed, hypothesis driven and iterative by nature.</p>
      <p>

      Lastly, the agency and client were all Japanese, I was one of only two foreigners on the project — navigating the cultural and language barriers required extra effort to keep up!</p>
